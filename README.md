# Simple-CRUD
This is a CRUD-style publication made as simple as possible, using only minimal JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with no database. I put the JavaScript and CSS codes inside the HTML to facilitate the visualization of the project. I'm sure that with more time available, I can further reduce the code while maintaining the code's quality and functionality. Later I will make a new CRUD with a LocalStorage database.
